# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-and-Techniques
Welcome to the Repository of Machine Learning Algorithms and Techniques!

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms and techniques that are intended to be a useful resource for studying and applying various machine learning approaches. This repository has you covered whether you're a newbie eager to enter into the area of machine learning or an experienced practitioner searching for reference implementations.


The following algorithms are included:

Linear Regression: A fundamental approach for modelling the connection between continuous goal variables and input variables.

Logistic Regression: A popular method for calculating the likelihood of a binary outcome in binary classification issues.

Decision Tree: A basic yet effective method for decision-making and classification that employs a tree-like paradigm.

Random Forest: A strong ensemble approach for improving accuracy and resilience by mixing numerous decision trees.

k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN): A non-parametric approach for categorising new instances based on the majority vote of their k nearest neighbours.

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on the Bayes theorem that is extensively used for text categorization and spam filtering.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): These models are useful for both classification and regression problems, and they make use of decision boundaries and kernel functions.


Included are the following techniques:

Cross-Validation: A technique for testing and fine-tuning machine learning models by comparing their performance on multiple data subsets.

One-Hot Encoding: A method of transforming categorical variables into numerical representation, allowing categorical data to be used in machine learning methods.

You will find clear and succinct implementations of various algorithms and approaches, as well as example datasets and usage instructions, in this repository. Each algorithm has its own directory that contains the essential code files as well as any supplementary resources.

We urge you to investigate the code, experiment with other datasets, and tweak the implementations to meet your individual requirements. Our purpose in offering this repository is to promote learning, cooperation, and innovation in the field of machine learning.

Please see the individual algorithm folders for detailed usage instructions, dependencies, and any extra remarks. Please contact us if you have any questions, ideas, or additions. Good luck with your machine learning!
